      <p class="legal-paragraph-text">Certain parts of the Service may be subject to additional terms and conditions specified by us from time to time; your use of such Service is subject to those additional terms and conditions, which are incorporated into these Terms of Service by this reference. Prices of the Service are subject to change upon 30 days’ notice from us.

    </div>
    <div class="div-block-1454">
      <h1 class="heading-25">3. Eligibility</h1>
      <p class="legal-paragraph-text">The Service is available only for individuals aged 13 years or older. If you are age 13 or older but under the age of 18, or the legal age of majority where you reside if that jurisdiction has an older age of majority, then you agree to review these Terms of Service with your parent or guardian to make sure that both you and your parent or guardian understand and agree to these Terms of Service. You agree to have your parent or guardian review and accept these Terms of Service on your behalf. If you are a parent or guardian agreeing to these Terms of Service for the benefit of a child over the age of 13, then you agree to and accept full responsibility for that child’s use of the Service, including all financial charges and legal liability that he or she may incur. We may, in our sole discretion, refuse to offer the Service to any person or entity and change the eligibility criteria for using the Service at any time. The right to access the Service is revoked where these Terms of Service or use of the Service is prohibited or to the extent offering, sale, or provision of the Service conflicts with any applicable law, rule or regulation.</p>
      <p class="legal-paragraph-text">If you are entering into these Terms of Service on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind such entity, its affiliates, and all users who access the Service through your account to these Terms of Service, in which case the terms “you” or “your” shall refer to such entity, its affiliates, and users associated with it. If you do not have such authority, or if you do not agree with these Terms of Service, you must not accept these Terms of Service and you may not use the Service. You further agree that you assume all responsibility and liability in connection with your use of the Service on behalf of such a company or other legal entity, and you shall be solely responsible for all disputes, if any, that arise due to your use of the Service on behalf of such a company or other legal entity.</p>
      <h1 class="heading-25">4. Account information</h1>
      <p class="legal-paragraph-text">We do not add any cookies to customer sites. The cookies described in this Policy only apply to Storipress&#x27; own marketing and product pages, not websites that are created and hosted using Storipress. Customers may make changes to their websites at their own discretion that may cause cookies to be added (for example, enabling Google Analytics, using a Facebook Like button, or adding custom code), but these changes are optional and not made by Storipress.</p>
      <p class="legal-paragraph-text"><strong>2. Your responsibility for your account.</strong> You are responsible for taking all steps to ensure that no unauthorised person shall have access to your account or password.  When creating your account, you must provide accurate and complete information. We encourage you to use “strong” passwords (passwords that use a combination of upper- and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols) with your account. It is your sole responsibility to:</p>
      <p class="legal-paragraph-text">(i) control the dissemination and use of your account and password; and<br>(ii) promptly inform us of any need to deactivate an account or password.</p>
      <p class="legal-paragraph-text">We are not liable for any harm related to the theft of passwords, or your disclosure of passwords. You shall immediately notify us of any unauthorised use of your account or password or any breach of confidentiality. You are solely responsible for any damage resulting from the use of your account and username. You may not use your account or password to breach security of another account.</p>
      <p class="legal-paragraph-text"><strong>3. How to control your account.</strong> You may control your account and how you interact with the Service by changing your settings. By providing us with your email address, you consent to our using the email address to send you Service-related notices, including any notices required by law, in lieu of communication by postal mail. We may also use your email address to send you other messages, such as changes to features of the Service. You may not opt out of these messages unless you cancel your account. For more information, please read our <a href="../legal/global-privacy-policy" target="_blank" class="link-6">Global Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

      <p class="legal-paragraph-text">We allow you to post or publish content on or upload content to the Service, including but not limited to site templates created and contributed by you, article or blog posts, images, and photos.

By submitting any Feedback, you agree that your disclosure is gratuitous, unsolicited, and without restriction and will not place Storipress under any fiduciary or other obligation, and that we are free to use the Feedback without any additional compensation to you, and/or to disclose the Feedback on a non-confidential basis or otherwise to anyone. You further acknowledge that, by acceptance of your submission, Storipress does not waive any rights to use similar or related Feedback previously known to Storipress, or developed by its employees, or obtained from sources other than you. Additionally, you acknowledge that all email and other correspondence that you submit to us shall become our sole and exclusive property.</p>
      <p class="legal-paragraph-text">For the purposes of this Agreement, “Intellectual Property Rights” means all patent rights, copyright rights, moral rights, rights of publicity, trademark, trade dress and service mark rights, goodwill, trade secret rights and other intellectual property rights as may now exist or hereafter come into existence, and all applications therefore and registrations, renewals, and extensions thereof, under the laws of any state, country, territory, or other jurisdiction.</p>
      <p class="legal-paragraph-text">You own all of the User Content you post or publish (“post”) on the Service. You grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide license to use, modify, reproduce, display, and distribute your User Content on the Service for the purposes of marketing your content and operating and providing the Service to you and other users (“Publisher Agreement”).

      <h1 class="heading-25">7. Rules</h1>
      <p class="legal-paragraph-text">Storipress uses cookies and similar tracking technologies to enable functionality on its Services, and to assist with marketing its products and services to interested individuals. Cookies help us improve by telling us our Services are being used, letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, and overall ensuring you enjoy your browsing experience on our Services. The chart below explains how we generally use cookies.</p>
      <h1 class="heading-26">Your obligations to End Users</h1>
      <p class="legal-paragraph-text"><strong>Roles. </strong>Storipress is a “service provider” to you, and you are a “customer” of our Services irrespective of whether you pay fees to obtain the Services. Any natural persons accessing or using your Storipress account, the websites, pages, features, or content created by you on our Services are deemed your “End Users.” Storipress does not have a direct relationship with any of your End Users, therefore Storipress is not responsible for how you handle End User information.</p>
      <p class="legal-paragraph-text"><strong>Applicable laws.</strong> You may have additional obligations under local law other than those described in this Terms of Service, particularly if you or your End Users are located outside of the Australia. Such obligations may be more restrictive than this Terms of Service.

      <p class="legal-paragraph-text">We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to modify, update, or change the Terms of Service (&quot;Updated Terms&quot;) from time to time, so you should review this page periodically. When we change the Agreement in a material manner, we will update the “last modified” date at the top of this page. Your continued use of the Service after any such change constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms of Service. If you do not agree to any of these terms or any future Terms of Service, do not use or access (or continue to access) the Service. Storipress is not responsible for any automatic filtering you or your network provider may apply to email notifications we send to the email address you provide us.</p>
      <p class="legal-paragraph-text">Unless we make a change for legal or administrative reasons, we will provide reasonable advance notice before the Updated Terms become effective. Storipress may provide such notifications, whether the notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business-related purposes, to you via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through posting of such notice on our website, as determined by Storipress in our sole discretion. Storipress reserves the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to our users, provided that you may opt out of certain means of notification by contacting us at hello@storipress.com. You agree that we may notify you of the Updated Terms by posting them on the Service, and that your use of the Service after the effective date of the Updated Terms (or engaging in such other conduct as we may reasonably specify) constitutes your agreement to the Updated Terms. Therefore, you should review these Terms of Service and any Updated Terms before using the Service. The Updated Terms will be effective as of the time of posting, or such later date as may be specified in the Updated Terms, and will apply to your use of the Service from that point forward. The Terms of Service will govern any disputes arising before the effective date of the Updated Terms.</p>
      <h1 class="heading-25">15. Dispute resolution</h1>
      <p class="legal-paragraph-text">INFORMAL NEGOTIATIONS. To expedite resolution and reduce the cost of any dispute, controversy or claim related to this Agreement (“Dispute”), you and Storipress agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating any arbitration or court proceeding. Such informal negotiations will commence upon written notice. Your address for such notices is your billing address, with an email copy to the email address you have provided to Storipress. Storipress&#x27; address for such notices is Albion Media Pty. Ltd, 8 Brewer Avenue, Liberty Grove, Sydney, Australia 2138.</p>
      <p class="legal-paragraph-text">BINDING ARBITRATION. If you and Storipress are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, all claims arising from use of the Service (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. Any election to arbitrate by one party will be final and binding on the other. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT IF EITHER PARTY ELECTS TO ARBITRATE, NEITHER PARTY WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT OR HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration will be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules (the “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (“AAA Consumer Rules”), both of which are available at the AAA website www.adr.org. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation will be governed by the AAA Rules (and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules). If your claim for damages does not exceed $10,000, Storipress will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, you and Storipress may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.</p>
      <p class="legal-paragraph-text">EXCEPTIONS TO ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION. Each party retains the right to bring an individual action in small claims court or to seek injunctive or other equitable relief on an individual basis in a federal or state court located within New South Wales, Australia with respect to any dispute related to the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a party’s intellectual property or proprietary rights.</p>
      <p class="legal-paragraph-text">WAIVER OF RIGHT TO BE A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN A PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. You and Storipress agree that any arbitration will be limited to the Dispute between Storipress and you individually. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU AND Storipress ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Storipress otherwise agree, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this “Dispute Resolution” Section will be deemed null and void.</p>
      <p class="legal-paragraph-text">LOCATION OF ARBITRATION. Arbitration will take place in New South Wales, Australia. You and Storipress agree that for any Dispute not subject to arbitration (other than claims proceeding in any small claims court), or where no election to arbitrate has been made, the New South Wales District and Federal courts located in Sydney, Australia have exclusive jurisdiction and you and Storipress agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts.</p>
