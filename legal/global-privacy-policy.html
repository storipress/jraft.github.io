      <h1 class="heading-25">2. How we collect, use, and share your Personal Information and other information</h1>
      <h1 class="heading-26">a. Information you provide to us</h1>
      <p class="legal-paragraph-text">When you register for the Service, we may ask for Personal Information such as your name, email address, or credit card or other billing information. You may also provide at your own discretion certain related information like your personal website name, social media websites, a list of your skills, the date you started using the Service, and a description of yourself. Additionally, as you employ the Sites to create websites, the software continuously saves changes made by you with the server and will document items such as when you are working and saving changes, when you last opened the Designer, when sites are published, or when you perform certain tasks.</p>
      <p class="legal-paragraph-text">We may also retain the contents of any messages you send to us or through the Service, and we may collect information you provide in user content that you post or upload to the Service (“User Content”).</p>
      <p class="legal-paragraph-text">Storipress may use Personal Information provided to operate, improve upon, and personalize the Service, for billing identification and authentication, to contact and communicate with you about the Service and your use of the Service, to support use of the Service, to send marketing materials for research purposes, and to generally improve the content and functionality of the Service.</p>
      <p class="legal-paragraph-text">We may also combine your Personal Information with third-party analytics information to build a broader profile of our individual users so that we can serve you better and provide custom, personalized content and information. Additionally, we may use the Personal Information we collect for identification and authentication and fraud prevention, to analyze Site usage and improve the Service, for internal market research, troubleshooting problems, to enforce our Terms of Service, and as otherwise set forth in this Policy.</p>
      <p class="legal-paragraph-text">Note that we will never email you to ask for your account information. If you ever receive such an email, please forward it to <a href="mailto:hello@storipress.com" class="link-6">hello@storipress.com</a>. For more information about our procedures in this regard, please review our <a href="../legal/terms" class="link-6">Terms of Service</a>.</p>
      <p class="legal-paragraph-text">We use financial information solely as authorised by you in accordance with the Service. While Storipress does not store your credit card information and will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of all credit card and all other Personal Information, we expressly disclaim any liability for any unauthorised access to or use of our secure servers and/or any and all personal and/or financial information stored therein, and you agree to hold Storipress harmless for any damages that may result therefrom.</p>
      <h1 class="heading-26">b. Information we may receive from and share with third parties</h1>
      <p class="legal-paragraph-text">We may now or in the future receive Personal Information about you from third parties. For example, if you access our Site or Service through a third-party connection or log-in or connect an application to Storipress, that third party you connected with may pass certain information about your use of its service to Storipress. This information could include, but is not limited to, the user ID associated with your account, an access token necessary to access that service, any information that you have permitted the third party to share with us, and any information you have made public in connection with that third-party service. You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to the Service.</p>
      <p class="legal-paragraph-text">Storipress may also share Personal Information with its third-party service providers (such as its credit card processors and hosting partners) to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and other service we use to operate the Service and maintain a high-quality user experience. We do not permit our service providers to use the Personal Information we share for their marketing purposes.</p>
      <h1 class="heading-26">c. Application integration</h1>
      <p class="legal-paragraph-text">To facilitate the exchange of data between third-party SaaS applications, we may need to store certain information (“App Credentials”) that helps us access these third-party SaaS application accounts on your behalf. We store your App Credentials in an encrypted form.</p>
      <p class="legal-paragraph-text">When we access these third-party applications on your behalf, the third-party application provides us with access to certain data. We will use, store, and disclose this data in accordance with this Policy.</p>
      <p class="legal-paragraph-text">You should note that Storipress shall have no liability or responsibility for the privacy practices or other actions of any third-party applications for which you provide us with App Credentials.</p>
      <h1 class="heading-26">d. Log file information</h1>
      <p class="legal-paragraph-text">We collect certain technical information from the visitors to our customers’ websites. The information that our web servers log about our Service customers’ site visitors includes Internet Protocol (IP) address; the date/time a webpage or feature is accessed; the user agent string that identifies the browser or operating system to the server; installed fonts; mime-types; browser language and timezone; Silverlight data; installed plugins; HTTP headers; and screen resolution.</p>
      <p class="legal-paragraph-text">Storipress uses this information in order to monitor the volume of our customers’ website traffic. We do this, for instance, to facilitate customer billing when a tiered pricing plan is based on the number of unique visitors to a customer’s website. We also use this technical information for our own analytical purposes, such as to measure how many customers have published active websites using our Service. Lastly, we may use this information to create separate analytics products that we offer to customers--using information that is not directly identifiable to any individual--to help customers visualize how their site is being used, to track conversions, and to provide other measurement metrics.</p>
      <h1 class="heading-26">e. Other information sharing</h1>
      <p class="legal-paragraph-text">We may be required to disclose Personal Information to respond to subpoenas, court orders, and law enforcement or governmental requests or investigations, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. We may also share Personal Information if we believe it is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations or our Terms of Service, or as otherwise required by law.</p>

We use commercially reasonable technological, physical, and administrative security safeguards, such as firewalls and carefully developed security features, to protect the confidentiality and security of your Personal Information within the Service and the Sites. When you enter confidential information (such as login credentials or information submitted from within the Service) we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). These technologies, procedures, and other measures are used in an effort to ensure that your data is safe, secure, and only available to you and to those you authorised to access your data. However, no internet, email, or other electronic transmission is ever fully secure or error-free, so you should take care in deciding what information you send to us in this way. Storipress is not responsible for the functionality or security measures of any third party.</p>
      <h1 class="heading-25">7. Hosting and data transfer</h1>
      <p class="legal-paragraph-text">We are based in Australia, but, unless we expressly agree otherwise (including through our Terms), we may host, transfer, and process data, including Personal Information, in Australia and in other countries through Storipress and third parties that we use to operate and manage the Service.  These countries may have data protection laws that are different from those of your country of residence. Storipress uses a variety of safeguards, including contractual and technical measures, to protect the data we transfer.</p>
      <h1 class="heading-25">8. Choice</h1>
      <p class="legal-paragraph-text">We process and store information on behalf of our customers. You may decline to submit any Personal Information through the Service, in which case we may not be able to provide certain services to you.</p>

      <p class="legal-paragraph-text">Please refer to your mobile device or browser’s technical information for instructions on how to delete and disable cookies, and other tracking / recording tools.

However, doing so may disable many of the features available through the Service. You may opt-out individually for third-party vendors on their websites, but limitations on data sharing may make it difficult or impossible to provide the Service after an opt-out.  You may also opt out of interest-based advertising provided by participating ad servers through the Digital Advertising Alliance (<a href="http://optout.aboutads.info/" target="_blank" class="link-6">http://optout.aboutads.info/</a>), the Network Advertising Initiative (<a href="http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1" target="_blank" class="link-6">http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1</a>), or the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (<a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/" target="_blank" class="link-6">http://www.youronlinechoices.eu</a>).</p>

      <p class="legal-paragraph-text">Customers may update, delete, or change your Personal Information you have provided Storipress by logging in to the Service and providing such additional information or deleting such information where applicable. If you are not our customer and would like to gain access to, or request deletion of, information we have collected, please contact us at hello@storipress.com.

      <h1 class="heading-25">10. Data retention</h1>
      <p class="legal-paragraph-text">Storipress will retain Personal Information we process on behalf of our customers or collect directly from our customers for as long as needed to provide Service to our customers, subject to our compliance with this Policy, or as required or permitted under the applicable law. We may further retain and use this Personal Information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations; maintain accurate accounting, financial, and other operational records; resolve disputes; and enforce our agreements. We have established internal policies for the deletion of data from customer accounts following termination of a customer’s subscription to the Service.</p>
      <h1 class="heading-25">11. Children&#x27;s Personal Information</h1>
      <p class="legal-paragraph-text">Storipress does not knowingly collect any Personal Information from children under the age of 13. <strong>If you are under the age of 13, please do not submit any Personal Information through our Service.</strong> We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s internet usage and to help enforce our Policy by instructing their children never to provide Personal Information on our Service without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided Personal Information to Storipress through our Service, please contact us, and we will use commercially reasonable efforts to delete that information from our databases.</p>
      <h1 class="heading-25">12. Changes to the Privacy Policy</h1>

We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices. Your continued use of the Service constitutes your acceptance to such changes to this Policy. If you do not accept the terms of this Policy, you should immediately discontinue use of the Service.</p>
      <h1 class="heading-25">13. Business transactions</h1>
      <p class="legal-paragraph-text">Storipress may assign or transfer this Policy, and your user account and related Personal Information, to any person or entity that acquires all or substantially all of the business, stock or assets of, or is merged with Storipress. We may also transfer or assign such information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, acquisitions, bankruptcies, dissolutions, or similar transactions or proceedings, provided that the recipient of such information will continue to be bound by the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
